mmm = '''
1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.870
every single industry in the world

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.930
has been affected in some way bike over nineteen

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.300
retail stores have been shut down

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.610
tourist sites have

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.550
have been closed

6
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.820
barbers

7
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.970
a bongos cheer heads just to keep up their skills

8
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.920
and one industry that needs to remain open in order for us to survive

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.400
is the food industry

10
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.960
but now the virus

11
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.380
is coming for that true

12
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.990
the food supply chain is breaking

13
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:35.060
that's the warning in a full page ad from Tyson foods released in the new York times it comes after one of the country's largest meat processors closed a massive pork processing plant in

14
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:45.060
in Iowa because of a corona virus outbreak a USA today investigation found one hundred and fifty of the nation's largest plants are in counties where the infection rate is spiking

15
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:55.060
biking threatening not only workers but potentially the food supply this morning with beef increasingly scarce president Trump promising to take action signing an executive order

16
00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.950
order under the defense production act to ensure processing plants stay open and run at the maximum extent possible

17
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.740
you know I say this about Trump he is very clear about

18
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.580
about what his priorities are in life

19
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.350
because he was warned for months about

20
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.110
about the pandemic coming to America

21
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.470
he did practically nothing

22
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.590
but you tell the man once

23
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.130
that they could be a beef shortage

24
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.160
and he springs into action like the wolves hungry as superhero and Dan Moore that's Trump man

25
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.860
if there's one thing we know about him

26
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.560
it's that he loves meet you know he must have been really disappointed when I

27
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.970
when he heard that a meat loaf was gonna be on the apprentice

28
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.960
and it turned out to be an actual man named meatloaf

29
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.310
who the hell is this

30
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.850
I can't put gravy on this man

31
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.340
I mean I sure as hell will try but yes

32
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.010
few places in America

33
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.480
have seen a higher rate of corona virus cases

34
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.430
then meet

35
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.410
processing plants

36
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.450
and although that doesn't seem to be a danger to the food itself

37
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.540
in most of these facilities

38
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.640
the workers are quite literally

39
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.300
putting their lives on the line

40
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:07.600
processing plants can be a breeding ground for the virus because many workers spend their days side by side you're not talking about two hundred people you're talking about several thousand people have

41
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.960
are very close

42
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.170
we can

43
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.660
use a social distance

44
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.100
adopt plates one employee concealing their identity for fear of retribution tells us plant managers were asked why fewer employees were showing up

45
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.930
adding the virus was rarely mentioned if at all

46
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:33.950
people start being carried out of there and so we were always asked our supervisors are sickly what is it that's going on here bitch notice for a five hundred dollar attendance bonus

47
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.850
enticed employees

48
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.080
to keep working

49
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.290
the Union representing workers says one month of request for pp e we're basically ignored

50
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.930
employees tell us workers were given hair nets to uses face masks

51
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.990
Hana

52
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.370
come on people let us some bullshit

53
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.440
what cars were given handouts

54
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.120
to wear as face masks

55
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.770
peanuts

56
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.720
Kon stop the

57
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.300
the virus

58
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.390
I don't even think hangouts can stop here I'm eating school lunch and you don't

59
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.760
it's really sad

60
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.870
that these workers are being forced to keep the food chain going

61
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.720
but nobody is being forced to

62
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.800
to protect them

63
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.610
while they do it

64
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.290
they need equipment

65
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.270
to keep safe

66
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.340
while doing their jobs

67
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.280
and if you eat meat

68
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.450
you especially should want these workers to be treated right

69
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.600
because without them

70
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.430
the only way you're getting bacon is if you fight the pig yourself

71
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.320
we all know how that's gonna end

72
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.940
troubles at meat processing plants

73
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.760
is one problem

74
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.030
but there's also

75
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.020
another problem that's messing up the food supply chain right now

76
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.320
and that's distribution

77
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.280
because with everyone locked down

78
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.380
and eating at home

79
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.660
the food that used to go to restaurants and schools

80
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.720
has now got nowhere to go

81
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:50.920
before the pandemic I want to estimate twenty four million cases of food were delivered every day to restaurants schools and large venues in bulk

82
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.440
and to repackage it for sale in grocery stores takes time and money

83
00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:04.290
with restaurants closed demand for butter and cheese has dropped significantly farmers who can no longer get their products to restaurants and other customers

84
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:14.300
are discarding millions of pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables bars and breweries tapping out like Minnesota is bow house brew labs forced to dump nine hundred gallons of perfect

85
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.210
perfectly fine bruh ski down the drain as demand for draught beer dries up

86
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.160
damn

87
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.870
they had to dump nine hundred gallons

88
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.400
of craft beer

89
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.950
down the dream

90
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.190
right now

91
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.290
all over America

92
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.150
fraternity house flags are flying at half mast

93
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.800
although it's not bad news for everyone I mean

94
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.060
I mean down in the sewers

95
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.560
the hipster rats are having the time of their lives

96
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.420
but the supply chain problems don't surprise me at all

97
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.080
I mean of course people don't eat the same way at home

98
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.450
as they would in restaurants

99
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.000
nobody at home is like you know what I could do tonight honey

100
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.280
I could have a seafood tower why don't you bring out one of those triple decker trades that we always used for the seafood and this gap between what

101
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.770
factories and farmers are producing and what people are now eating

102
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.180
isn't just messing up the food chain in the United States

103
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.290
it's happening all over the world

104
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.510
in fact it's gotten so bad that

105
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.660
that one country

106
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.460
is calling on all of it's citizens to help out

107
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.700
in a special way

108
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.610
meanwhile in Belgium people are being asked to eat twice the amount of French fries

109
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.180
all in an effort to prevent food waste according to research Belgians already

110
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.600
typically eat fries at least once a week but

111
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.740
but potato farmers say if everyone doubles the amount of consumption it could prevent nearly seven hundred and fifty thousand tons

112
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.180
of surplus potatoes from going to waste

113
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.510
wow Belgians are being asked

114
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.360
to help eat seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds of extra French fries

115
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.060
let's seems like a challenge but if

116
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.650
if they can borrow sum weed from Amsterdam next door

117
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.670
they can knock that out in like a day tops I'm not gonna lie

118
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.030
I get that this is a problem

119
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.900
but personally

120
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.950
being asked

121
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.600
to eat more French fries

122
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.930
that would be

123
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.060
my dream

124
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.340
come true

125
00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.950
to give you the full story

126
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.090
my dream is

127
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.090
is that I'm eating extra French fries

128
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.390
because j lo Kon finish hers

129
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.740
because she ate too many appetizers during our wedding's cocktail hour

130
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.700
and then she wants to save some room for cake

131
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.250
but that's basically the dream it's close enough

132
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.550
here's what I say

133
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.230
if Belgium

134
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.260
can solve its food chain problems

135
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.750
by asking people just to eat more French fries

136
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.170
then surely

137
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.230
the United States of America

138
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.780
can step up to

139
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.290
America

140
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:35.550
we're going through difficult times disease lockdown they even delayed the new James bond movie

141
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.140
looking forward to that

142
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.750
but if there's one thing this crisis has presented to Americans

143
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.860
it's a challenge that we are uniquely prepared to face

144
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:56.370
food waste all over this great nation food that was supposed to go to restaurants and school cafeterias is being thrown away

145
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.690
because we can't eat in such huge quantities in

146
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.870
but we can't

147
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.920
we have we can't miss the USA

148
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:16.280
wait wait a country that have been in super sized hot dog eating contest and fighting to the death of a fried chicken sandwich we've been training for this crisis iron

149
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:26.280
our entire lives so America I need you to join with me and stuff your faces like your lives and your country depends on it because it does

150
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:35.700
does wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow

151
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.480
well that's how show for tonight but before we go

152
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.460
please remember

153
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.080
that because the covert pandemic has devastated communities around the world

154
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.950
but international medical corps is helping those communities rebuild

155
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.850
and recover

156
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.610
but they need your help to do it

157
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.070
